Room Gotos rewrite
- Ideally targetX, targetY, and targetroom
- remove rm_transition from the equation, lowering ram usage and lag
- surface effect happens on the oControl end, with the transition effect, and camera values being set during the Surface's full opacity
- Camera starts near door, with instant teleport to new fix position instead of capped speed.
- everything in room is paused during the transition event
- Fix Position for cam decided by camlimit, camwall, and screen edge.
- transition effect happens after cam is fixed in the initial room frame
- transition needs, x and y of player on screen after camera is fixed. find the difference and calculate new "screen position"
- lerp surface pos to new screen pos like normal
- unpause everything in room

Main problem is setting all objects to not be active until transition is done, an issue I need solved for Pause Menu anyway

CameraLimit

Made CameraLimit stretch in Editor. Stretches from Top Left to Bottom Right (THIS BREAKS VANILLA CAMS. BE ADVISED)
Made CameraWallL, and CameraWallR Stretch vertically in editor.
Made CameraWallD stretch horizontally in editor.

Fixes an issue where walking from a CameraLimit to a CameraWallD Region within a frame caused the Camera's yPosition to become locked.

oWeaponParent System
- Parent of all Weapons used against enemies and Bosses and blocks and etc
- Stores initial values and attributes shared between all weapons, and specific values shared between certain weapons.
- Helps with enemy referencing, since oEnemy likes to crash if a weapon is not specified as either supermissileicebeam or not.

Global Object Pausing
- Make all objects that need to move and affect the player subject to a Global pause system.
- Enemies, Projectiles, Player, and mechanisms need to pause when exiting a new Goto, or when in a reworked Pause menu in Singleplayer
- Can also be used in Cutscene events, special FX, and a TIMESTOP mechanic if we go that far :)

base Enemy Rework
- Rework the base enemy to require less specified behavior to function.
- Move specific interactions to their own events, such as freezing or burning
- Reassign old Enemy types (like Metroids and Bosses) to be children of oEnemy, and this affected by weapons that oEnemy would be.

-  need a Parent objects for specific things (AKA Metroid and Boss)
-  set specific interactions as collision events for certain weapons with event_inherited, then writing specifics can happen per enemy as usual


General goal is to take all the broad things and comdense them, while leaving specific cases to specific targets.
